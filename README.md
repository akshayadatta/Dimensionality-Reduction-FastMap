# Dimensionality-Reduction-FastMap

For fast searching in traditional and multimedia databases, it is necessary to map objects into
points in k-d space, using k feature-extraction functions provided by a domain expert.
Fast map is a fast algorithm to map objects into points in k-dimensional space such that the dis-
similarities are preserved.

Thus we can use highly fine-tuned spatial access methods to answer several types of queries
including
Query By Example
All pairs query
Nearest-neighbor query
Best-match query
Also we can use it for visualization and data-mining. The objects can now be plotted in 2-d, 3-d
space, revealing potential clusters, correlations among attributes.
This method is compared with Multidimensional Scaling although it is unsuitable for indexing
whereas Fast Map is suitable for indexing.
It is significantly faster than MDS. Fast map is a linear time algorithm where as MDS is a
quadratic time algorithm.

Fast map is suitable for indexing as it preserves distances and the overall structure of the data-
